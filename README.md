#### What is REBLOCKED?
REBLOCKED is a small but popular and open source website that acts as a way to help stop boredom at school. It has around 25 games that work with just the website (located in the REBLOCKED folder) and another 25 games that work with the modified Alloy proxy (located in the Alloy folder) that allows for multiplayer, and unlimited online access.
