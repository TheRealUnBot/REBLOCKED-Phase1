# REBLOCKED Phase1
## What is REBLOCKED?
REBLOCKED is a small but popular and open source website that acts as a way to help stop boredom at school. It has around 25 games that work with just the website (located in the REBLOCKED folder) and another 25 games that work with the modified Alloy proxy (located in the Alloy folder) that allows for multiplayer, and unlimited online access.
## How do I run it?
Note: These commands are for linux but to run on windows is pretty straight forward anyways.
1. Install Mono and NodeJs
2. Unzip both directories
3. Go into the REBLOCKED directory and run Main.exe using Mono.
4. Exit the REBLOCKED directory, go into the Alloy directory, and edit Config file to set firewall, and proxy directory name.
5. Run index.js using NodeJs
6. Go to localhost to see REBLOCKED
## What's Next?
Well Phase 2 is on its way with better blocking and posiiblly free Wifi but it requires and Raspberry Pi 4 or 3 to use!
